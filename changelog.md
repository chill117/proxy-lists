* v1.20.2:
  * Upgraded dependencies
* v1.20.1:
  * Upgraded dependencies:
    * upgraded version of data-sourcer includes stability and error-handling improvements
* v1.20.0:
  * Can now pass options to [dataSourcer](https://github.com/chill117/data-sourcer#getdata) when calling `getProxies` and `getProxiesFromSource`. Most relevant options:
    * `browser` - Options object passed to [puppeteer.launch(options)](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.19.0&show=api-puppeteerlaunchoptions)
    * `sourcesDir` - Directory path where your sources are defined. Default is the "sources" directory included with the ProxyLists project.
  * Calls to `getProxies` and `getProxiesFromSource` will now both clean-up by calling the `dataSourcer.close` method once all the sources have sent their end event. This has the effect of automatically closing any browser instances used by proxy sources.
* v1.19.0:
  * Several new sources, more info scraped from existing sources
  * Close browser tabs used by source when it sends its end event
  * Overall better error handling
